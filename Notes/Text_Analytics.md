##Initial Notes from Review of Readings

- TA as a tool
- over quantification
- bias of the analyst
- ensuring it alights with research objectives
- difficult to use for complex ideas/thoughts
- cost-effective
- the structure and use of the tools drives the validity and replicability of the analysis. 
- importance of identifying the methodology used and filters/features of the tool in order to allow others to replicate.
- Need for a benefits/drawbacks of different tools and identification of what cases they are best used for.

- adaption - scrambling, broad definitions, 

###Acivities
- counts - what is the use of this? random words?
- functional vs. contextual words - frequency

###Visualization
- Word cloud - larger word more frequently, lacks context
- Sentiment - database is important, source of analysis tool, semantic vector of a word, ratemyprof - context word about gender changes
- ran 5-6, overall neutral, 
-AntConc - tutorial on programming historian about how to use (words before and after, frequency)
- Limitations across them, shiney hammer problem - frequency of use, how they graph together
- corpus.byu.edu
- voyant - McGill/Alberta co collaboration
- there is a manual with background info for more information
- doc titles with numbering or dares will allow for a timeseries graph
